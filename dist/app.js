We did so by going back to where the line began, to Ilon Specht, the young McCann copywriter who fought so hard to bring those words to life. We worked with two-time Oscar-winning filmmaker Ben Proudfoot to capture Specht, now in her senior years and facing a terminal illness, in her New York apartment. She reflects on making the original ad at a time when so many forces were working against her, and, all throughout, her fire and unfiltered voice come to life: sharp, defiant and unapologetic. No brand messaging. No product shots. Just truth. The ultimate embodiment of "I'm worth it." We gave Ilon Specht back her words and her authorship. We didn't modernize her line. We reminded the world of its original power, and the world listened.`,impact:"More than 75% of people who saw the film reported that it changed their perception of the brand",vimeoId:"1131846355",vimeoPreviewId:"1135324224",awards:[{type:"cannes",label:"Grand Prix (Film), Gold Lion (Entertainment) Silver Lions (Entertainment, PR) Bronze Lion (Film Craft), Brand Content Awards \u2014 Grand Prix"},{type:"gerety",label:"Grand Prix"},{type:"ciclope",label:"Grand Prix"},{type:"clubdesda",label:"Grand Prix"}]},"mastercard-abracadabra":{client:"Mastercard",title:"Abracadabra: From Fan to Featured",truth:"Music fans want to live their passion, not just listen to it.",truthWellTold:"From Fan to Featured",description:"Gen Z doesn't just watch culture, they make it.
