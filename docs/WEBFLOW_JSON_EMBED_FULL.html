    "description": "Fifty years after \"Because I'm Worth It\" was written, its meaning had become eroded by time. What began as a statement of rebellion had softened into a tagline — spoken everywhere but rarely felt. Our idea was not to reinterpret it, but to reclaim it. We did so by going back to where the line began, to Ilon Specht, the young McCann copywriter who fought so hard to bring those words to life. We worked with two-time Oscar-winning filmmaker Ben Proudfoot to capture Specht, now in her senior years and facing a terminal illness, in her New York apartment. She reflects on making the original ad at a time when so many forces were working against her, and, all throughout, her fire and unfiltered voice come to life: sharp, defiant and unapologetic. No brand messaging. No product shots. Just truth. The ultimate embodiment of \"I'm worth it.\" We gave Ilon Specht back her words and her authorship. We didn't modernize her line. We reminded the world of its original power, and the world listened.",

Mastercard and Gaga fueled the movement by liking, reposting, and celebrating fans across platforms. The strategy was rooted in Gen Z's desire for self-expression and social connection — turning fan behavior into the engine of engagement. The result: 1.4 billion views, TikTok's top branded hashtag, and Mastercard's biggest-ever Gen Z brand lift.",

    "description": "Modern football is dominated by a few rich clubs that can afford to hire big teams of coaches and analysts, which means smaller clubs struggle to compete for talent. For the launch of Football Manager 24 — the most realistic football simulator — Xbox helped the small club Bromley FC recruit their next tactician from an untapped talent pool: gamers. The announcement made headlines everywhere, and people from around the world applied. Nathan Owolabi, a dedicated Football Manager player, got the job. He used data from the game to help the club win in the real world, developing formations, finding new strategies, and uncovering the opposition's weaknesses. The story of this unusual approach to football was told in a 60+ minute documentary on TNT Sports — the UK's biggest sports broadcaster. With the help of a gamer, the club achieved its best season in its 132-year history, ultimately gaining promotion to League Two for the first time ever. Xbox saw a dramatic increase in Football Manager players on console, and Football Manager 24 became the most-played game in the history of the franchise.",

The story is told through immersive cinematography, 3D transitions, and iconic vehicles that act as portals through time. Every frame was carefully crafted, combining historical accuracy with emotional depth. Narrated by Fernanda Torres, one of Brazil's most celebrated actresses, the film aired nationally on Chevrolet's 100th anniversary. More than a celebration, it became a statement about memory, progress, and connection, reminding Brazilians that Chevrolet has not just been a car brand, but a part of their country's journey.",

With financial inclusion now central to Mastercard's brand purpose, \"Priceless\" has evolved beyond messaging into groundbreaking product innovations, tools, and platforms. Among them: the \"True Name\" card, allowing transgender individuals to have their real names inscribed on their credit cards; the \"Touch Card\" system that lets sight-impaired consumers to distinguish their credit, debit, and pre-paid cards by touch; the \"Where to Settle\" tool that helps Ukrainian refugees in Poland find the ideal areas to make their new homes; the \"Where to Start\" tool that helps create a symbiotic financial ecosystem between resettled Ukrainian refugees and their Polish neighbors; and the new \"Life Donor Card\" and \"ATM Voting\" projects, which have turned millions of users into organ donors and helped citizens decide how the government uses their money, respectively.",

Puck, a trusted Middle Eastern dairy brand, saw an opportunity in what remained: the women's family recipes, passed down for generations. \"Recipe for Change\" transformed these cultural heirlooms into intellectual property by licensing the recipes to Lebanese and fusion restaurants around the world. Each dish sold generated income, with 50% of profits going directly to the women behind them. The strategy reframed these women not as victims, but as business partners, restoring dignity and agency. Launched during Ramadan, a time rooted in generosity, the campaign created a scalable B2B2C model that connected communities across borders. It not only supported displaced women but also drove new revenue for restaurants and redefined how brands can build equity, empathy, and economic impact during crisis.",
